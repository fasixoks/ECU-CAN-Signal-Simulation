# ECU CAN Signal Simulation

Welcome to the ECU CAN Signal Simulation repo! This project is all about simulating CAN signals in an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) environment using MATLAB. Weâ€™ve packed this script with advanced signal processing, control systems, and real-time data visualization to make it as robust and useful as possible for anyone working with embedded systems and electronics.

## Features

- **Signal Generation**: Mixes sine wave, square wave, and Gaussian noise for a realistic signal.
- **Signal Processing**: Uses a low-pass Butterworth filter to clean up the signal.
- **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Applies Fourier Transform to break down the signal into its frequency components.
- **RMS Calculation**: Computes the Root Mean Square to measure signal power.
- **PID Controller**: Implements a PID controller to mimic control systems in ECUs.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Updates a 3D plot dynamically to show the signal components over time.
- **CAN Message Simulation**: Constructs and prints out simulated CAN messages for a bit of realism.

## Mathematical Equations

### Signal Generation
The combined signal y(t) is generated as:
y(t) = A * sin(2 * pi * f * t) + B * square(2 * pi * f * t) + N(0, sigma^2)
where:
- A is the amplitude of the sine wave.
- f is the frequency of the sine wave.
- B is the offset of the square wave.
- N(0, sigma^2) represents Gaussian noise with mean 0 and variance sigma^2.

### Low-Pass Filtering
A 2nd order Butterworth low-pass filter is applied to the signal:
H(s) = (b0 + b1 * s + b2 * s^2) / (a0 + a1 * s + a2 * s^2)

where j is the imaginary unit.

### RMS Calculation
The Root Mean Square (RMS) value of the signal y(t) is calculated as:
RMS = sqrt((1 / N) * sum(y(t_n)^2))

where N is the number of samples.

### PID Controller
The PID controller output u(t) is determined by:
u(t) = Kp * e(t) + Ki * integral(e(t)) + Kd * derivative(e(t))

where:
- Kp is the proportional gain.
- Ki is the integral gain.
- Kd is the derivative gain.
- e(t) is the error signal.



## How to Use

1. **Clone the repo**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/fasixoks/ECU-CAN-Signal-Simulation.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd ECU-CAN-Signal-Simulation
    ```

3. **Run the MATLAB script**:
    Open [`can.m`](https://github.com/fasixoks/ECU-CAN-Signal-Simulation/blob/main/can.m) in MATLAB and hit run. Sit back and watch the magic happen.
