# ECU CAN Signal Simulation

Welcome to the ECU CAN Signal Simulation repo! This project is all about simulating CAN signals in an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) environment using MATLAB. Weâ€™ve packed this script with advanced signal processing, control systems, and real-time data visualization to make it as robust and useful as possible for anyone working with embedded systems and electronics.

## Features

- **Signal Generation**: Mixes sine wave, square wave, and Gaussian noise for a realistic signal.
- **Signal Processing**: Uses a low-pass Butterworth filter to clean up the signal.
- **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Applies Fourier Transform to break down the signal into its frequency components.
- **RMS Calculation**: Computes the Root Mean Square to measure signal power.
- **PID Controller**: Implements a PID controller to mimic control systems in ECUs.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Updates a 3D plot dynamically to show the signal components over time.
- **CAN Message Simulation**: Constructs and prints out simulated CAN messages for a bit of realism.

## Mathematical Equations

### Signal Generation
The combined signal \( y(t) \) is generated as:
\[ y(t) = A \sin(2 \pi f t) + B \cdot \text{square}(2 \pi f t) + N(0, \sigma^2) \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amplitude of the sine wave.
- \( f \) is the frequency.
- \( B \) is the offset for the square wave.
- \( N(0, \sigma^2) \) represents Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance \( \sigma^2 \).

### Low-Pass Filtering
A Butterworth low-pass filter is designed and applied:
\[ H(s) = \frac{b_0 + b_1 s + b_2 s^2}{a_0 + a_1 s + a_2 s^2} \]

### Fourier Transform
The frequency domain representation is obtained using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):
\[ Y(f) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} y(t) e^{-j 2 \pi f t} \]

### RMS Calculation
The Root Mean Square (RMS) value is calculated as:
\[ \text{RMS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} y(t_n)^2} \]

### PID Controller
The PID control law is implemented as:
\[ u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int e(t) dt + K_d \frac{d e(t)}{dt} \]
where:
- \( K_p \) is the proportional gain.
- \( K_i \) is the integral gain.
- \( K_d \) is the derivative gain.
- \( e(t) \) is the error signal.

## How to Use
